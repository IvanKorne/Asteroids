# Asteroids
(I have lost the folder that came with the code due to switching to a new laptop)

My most advanced project I have created was the classic game Asteroids, using Object-Orientated Programming. It was the first program I've ever made that used the controls such as the up, down, left and right keys.
Fit with a custom loading screen and music, as well as classes including the ship, asteroid, and a UFO I unfortunately have not yet finished, but working on to this day!
